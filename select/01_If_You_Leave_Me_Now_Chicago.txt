If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me

Ooh-ooh-hoo, no
Baby, please don't go

And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me

Ooh-ooh-hoo, no
Baby, please don't go
Ooh-ooh-hoo, girl
I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find

How could we let it slip away?

We've come too far to leave it all behind

How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

A love like ours is love that's hard to find

How could we let it slip away?

We've come too far to leave it all behind

How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh-ooh-hoo, no
Baby, please don't go

Ooh, girl
Just got to have you by my side

Ooh-ooh-hoo, no
Baby, please don't go

Ooh, mama
I just got to have your loving here
