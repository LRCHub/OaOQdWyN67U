Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
She say its hard for me you know
But I got to do, what I have to do
Because I can't do this no more
With you it ain't worth it
You need to find something or someone else
To occupy your time
Because I can't do this no more
Its so hard to say goodbye
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
I think I've played my part for a very long time
Too, after all the things i've heard about you
I don't pay them no mind
cause I know people see things differently
But I say baby baby, look how far we come from
Baby baby, I will never leave you alone
I will never let you down
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
She say its hard for me you know
But I got to do, what I have to do
Because I can't do this no more
With you it ain't worth it
You need to find something or someone else
To occupy your time
Because I can't do this no more
Its so hard to say goodbye
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
Nuh leave me
Nuh leave me, leave me
Give me another chance
Give me another try
Its so hard to say goodbye
